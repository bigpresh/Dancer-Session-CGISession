NAME
    Dancer::Session::CGISession - CGI::Session session engine for Dancer

DESCRIPTION
    A session engine wrapper to allow Dancer apps to use CGI::Session
    sessions. Mostly useful if you need to share sessions created by
    non-Dancer apps which are already using CGI::Session.

    Work in progress; not yet ready for use.
